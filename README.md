### Senior Frontend Engineer / Product Engineer

I translate business requirements into polished UX/UI concepts and ship them with a modern stack.
From requirements engineering to branding to deployment -- everything end-to-end.

#### What I'm exploring

- LLMs and document intelligence
- Secure auth patterns and scalable backend design
- Developer-first tools with clean UI/UX
- Rust + Bevy for game development
- WebAssembly for performance-critical web features

<br>

#### Philosophy

> Good frontend doesn't start with code -- it starts with understanding the business.
> I analyze requirements, translate them into UX/UI concepts that fit the brand,
> and plan the project from idea to deployment.
