# 👋 Hi, I’m @VelimirMueller - Frontend/Fullstack Engineer


I'm a passionate (senior) software engineer with several years of experience building modern web applications with clean code, thoughtful UI/UX, and scalable backend systems. My focus is on crafting smooth user experiences, performant APIs, and maintainable architectures and I am a huge fan of TDD.

I enjoy working across the stack - from intuitive Vue.js frontends to secure Flask and Quarkus backends and game development with Rust and the Bevy Engine. Recently, I've been diving into AI/ML-powered apps, applying natural language processing and image classification in real-world tools.
